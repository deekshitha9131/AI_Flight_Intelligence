"""Gmail request/response schemas.

The API contract boundary for the /gmail/* endpoints — mirror the
application DTOs (app/application/dto/gmail.py) field-for-field via
`from_attributes`, same pattern UserRead uses for the User domain
entity. GmailSendRequest (Task 3.5) also enforces "invalid recipient"
and "no body content" at this boundary via Pydantic — before the
service or Gmail API are ever involved, consistent with UserCreate's
existing use of EmailStr.
